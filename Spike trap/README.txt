The file contain a script I wrote to create a spike trap for my unity 2D Platformer.
On entering collision with the player, a coroutine start that set the proper trigger for the animation of the spikes, and change the tag of the Game Object to "environement hazard".
I have scripted the player such as he dies if he collides to any environement hazard.
The trap is reset after a few seconds.
